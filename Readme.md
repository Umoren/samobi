## Samobi CSS

This is a simple CSS library built with SCSS from Netninja SCSS course.

I learnt about:
- mixins
- partials
- extend
- include
- for and each loops
- conditionals
- sass math library
- variables
- functions
- components
- structuring scss modules
- purgecss


### Installation

- Run npm install to install node_modules
- Run gulp to compile scss files
- Use Live Server extension on VS Code to run a development server for your html files
